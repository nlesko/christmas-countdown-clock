# christmas-countdown-clock
---

In the mood for holidays decided to put together this simple Christmas countdown clock.

It contains a countdown timer that is counting how much time is left till <br>
**December 25th**.

Besides the timer added simple snow-like background using canvas. <br>
Also what kind of Christmas would it be without some Christmas lights? :)


## Project Conclusion

Doing this little project I had a chance to expand my skills and get comfortable with:  
* HTML Canvas  
* Animations
* JavaScript DOM
* CSS Grid  

Putting together a timer was interesting on its own. But using HTML Canvas as a background effect and working with the positioning of elements was a great addition.  
Using absolute position and z-index to put Canvas behind, later, while positioning the container for other elements figured I should put top: 0 and left: 0 for Canvas too.  
Why? Well, by adding a margin-top to the container made snow start falling from that position instead from the top like it should.

Anyways you can view the clock yourself **[here](https://nlesko.github.io/projects/christmas-countdown-clock/)**
