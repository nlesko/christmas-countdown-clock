## Project Conclusion

Doing this little project I had chance to expand my skills and get comfortable with:  
* HTML Canvas  
* Animations
* JavaScript DOM
* CSS Grid  

Putting together timer was interesting on it's own. But using HTML Canvas as background effect and working with positioning of elements was great addition.  
Using absolute position and z-inddex to put Canvas behind, later, while position container for other elments figured I should put top: 0 and left: 0 for Canvas too.  
Why? Well by adding margin-top to container it made snow start falling from that position instead from the top like it should.
